# NinjaScripts

A collection of custom trading strategies built for NinjaTrader 8 using NinjaScript (C#). These scripts are designed to automate entries, exits, and risk management for futures trading, with a focus on compliance with prop firm evaluation rules (Apex, TopStep, etc.).

📌 Features

Pre-built strategies for futures trading (NQ, ES, YM, etc.).

Risk management tools: ATR stops, trailing stops, daily loss limits, auto-flatten logic.

Entry logic examples: moving average crossovers, VWAP pullbacks, RSI conditions, probability toggles.

Modular structure so you can plug in or modify your own setups.

Optimized for prop firm rule-sets (drawdown protection, scaling, max trades/day).
